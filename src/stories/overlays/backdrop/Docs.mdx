### Backdrop Component

The `Backdrop` component provides a semi-transparent overlay, typically used to obscure content behind modals, drawers, or popups.
It can be opened or closed by clicking on it, supports a customizable z-index, and can optionally render inside a portal for better layering control.

#### Props (typescript)

Here’s a list of the props for the `Backdrop` component:

```js
{
  open: boolean;
  duration?: number; must be same value as timeout
  portal?: boolean;
  timeout?: number; must be same value as duration
  zIndex?: number;
  ...props: HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>
}
```

#### Example Usage `Backdrop`

```tsx
<Backdrop portal={true} />
```
